**Hey there! 👋**

I'm Tejas Phopale, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Dr. D Y Patil ACS College, Pimpri, Pune . I'm pursuing an Bachelor's degree to build a strong foundation in tech. 🚀

I'm passionate about crafting dynamic and interactive web applications as a full-stack developer. 💻 I'm skilled in front-end tech like React, and backend magic with Express, MySQL, and MongoDB. 🌐 Building awesome websites is my jam! ⚡️

I've got a solid grip on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to tackle tough problems efficiently. 🧠 Plus, I'm handy with C,C++ and Java for versatile projects. 🛠️

I'm always hungry for new challenges and love collaborating on cool projects with like-minded folks. 🤝 I stay updated with the latest tech trends to keep growing. 🌱

Beyond studies, I dive into coding competitions and hackathons. 🏆 I love teamwork and brainstorming creative solutions. New projects and tech exploration excite me! 🤩

If you need a full-stack developer or DSA help, hit me up! Let's create something amazing together. 🚀 Feel free to connect at tejasph1@gmail.com. 📧
